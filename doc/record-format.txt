Record Format
-------------

Syntax notes:
- ( P )* means "zero or more of the P"
- ( P )+ means "one or more of the P"
- { P } means "zero or one of the P"
  (ie P is optional and may be omitted)

Old style records had the following format:
	":" password-crypt ":" destination
The destination was prefixed with '&' for a forward, and with either '.'
or '/' for a mailbox.

New version 1 records have the following format:
	0x01
	password-crypt NUL
	{ mailbox } NUL
	( alias NUL )* NUL
	personal-information NUL
	hard-quota NUL
	soft-quota NUL
	message-size-limit NUL
	message-count-limit NUL
	creation-time NUL
	expiry-time NUL

The maximum values for limits (quota, etc.) are expressed in the file as
"-" and internally as -1.  Records with an unknown creation time have
the creation-time set to "0".
