Here are the things that I have left to complete (roughly in order of
personal preference).  The lines marked "RELEASE TARGET" are the point
of development that I hope to reach before I make another release.  Some
of the other items after the last "RELEASE TARGET" may make it into a
release if I feel like it.  I want short and easy to define goals so I
can keep the development periods shorter.

- Modifiy the pop bulletin command to take the bulletin directory on the
  command line.

- Add a section to the FAQ regarding upgrading to the current version.

- Add a -q/--quiet option to all the command-line tools

- Continue to seperate the "misc" library directory into modules.

- Document the Python interface.

- Debug the Courier IMAP auth module

- Build sample HTML for the Python interface.

- Update the FAQ
  - Add a section about how checkvpw works

- Add more complete tests to verify correct operation of "vaddusers"
  command.

- add a "vadddomain" command that:
  - adds a new user to /etc/passwd
  - creates the new user directory
  - su's to that user and runs vsetup
  - fixes the user's home directory permissions
  - adds entries to control/virtualdomains
  - adds entries to control/rcpthosts

- dynamic information per mailbox:
  - total number of emails and bytes received
  - number of emails and bytes currently
  - time of first and last messages
  - last access time via POP3
  - text file named "data"
  - one line per datum, using "key=value" format

- Write library routines, interfaced through vpwentry, that can
  get/set the dynamic data.

- Per-user quotas, implemented as a program to be called by the above

- Set up the necessary structures to completely seperate the virtual
  domain information and the real user information, such that each user
  can have a list of virtual domains assigned to it.  This structure
  will specify:
  - a domain prefix
  - a directory
  In this way, the virtualdomains will contain:
    domain.org:username-prefix
  And the domain listing with list
    prefix:subdirectory
  Each domain will have a completely independant user directory and
  password table.

RELEASE TARGET 0.97

- Add the necessary code for compile-time switchable support for CDB,
  [GN]DBM, and MySQL virtual user databases

RELEASE TARGET 0.98

- Eliminate the "response" class, and replace with an integer index into
  a list of messages.

- Move the parsing of server commands out of dispatch and into the
  commands themselves.

- Change client-server protocol to use an integer instead of a string as
  the command identifier, and codify the command numbers.

RELEASE TARGET 0.99

- Bug fixes and clean-ups, and documentation improvements

RELEASE TARGET 1.00

- document vchattr, vchforwards

- limit the number of accounts created per virtual domain

- look into interoperating with sqwebmail http://www.inter7.com/sqwebmail/

- look into interoperating with qmailadmin http://www.inter7.com/qmailadmin/

- add support for a streaming protocol, such that multiple commands
  could be issued per daemon session

- in all the command-line programs:
  - if the environment variable VDOMAIN is set, read the virtual domain
    from that variable, prompt for a password, and do a server call

- write a "vlogin" program:
  - asks user for username & password
  - checks authentication with daemon
  - execs a subprogram, such as vpasswd, after changing uid/gid/cwd to
    that of the owner of the virtual domain (like checkvpw does)
  - ?If local address of connection is not a virtual domain, exec
    login or in.telnetd or similar?

- In vmailmgrd:
  ? add support for PAM for non-virtual users (this may be difficult,
    requiring a change in the authentication model)

- documentation
  - write a "getting started" guide

- miscelaneous
  - code clean-ups, including internal documentation
