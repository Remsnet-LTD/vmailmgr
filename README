checkvpw is a password checking utility designed specifically for
use with qmail-popup and qmail-pop3d.  On a host with no virtual
domains, it behaves much the same (in fact, it should be identical) to
the standard checkpassword by D. J. Bernstein.

See checkpassword for more details.  A link to it should be available
from http://www.qmail.org/  The man page for each program contained in
this package describe its operation.

This program was based on checkpassword by D. J. Bernstein, which in
turn was based on code contributed by Russ Nelson.
